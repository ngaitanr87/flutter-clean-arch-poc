# Spec Constitution [MANDATORY]

Constitution Version: v1.1.0  
Ratification Date: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Original adoption date unknown; determine from initial commit history.  
Last Amended Date: 2025-10-23

This document defines mandatory standards for designing, generating, and evolving multi-platform Clean Architecture projects (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter). All specs MUST comply. The Flutter-specific constitution (`.specify/memory/flutter/constitution.md`) extends this base; if conflicts arise, the global constitution prevails unless an ADR explicitly grants a platform exception with expiry.

**SpecKit Integration Guidance:**

- All rules, practices, and outputs defined herein are to be optimized for programmatic evaluation and automation by SpecKit toolchain.

- The constitution MUST be maintained in a machine-parseable, single-source-of-truth Markdown format for direct consumption by SpecKit.
- Section numbering, headings, and enforcement requirements (MANDATORY/NON-NEGOTIABLE) MUST remain explicit and consistently structured for SpecKit rule extraction.
- Output directory enforcement, CI gates, template references, and compliance checks MUST be kept up-to-date for SpecKit automation compatibility.

## 1. Glossary [MANDATORY]

- Clean Architecture Layer: Logical boundary (Presentation, Domain, Data) with restricted dependency direction.
- Use Case: A single application-specific business action encapsulated in a pure/service function.
- Repository: Abstraction mediating between domain and data sources (remote, cache, local) with offline support.
- DI Container: Mechanism that wires abstractions to implementations at bootstrap.
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record): Concise document capturing a significant technical choice, context, decision, consequences.
- Offline-first: Strategy ensuring core functionality remains usable without network; sync when connectivity returns.
- Pinned Version: Exact immutable dependency version (no range/caret).
- Feature Branch: Short-lived branch implementing a single scoped change merged via squash into main.
- Core packages -> Abstractions of third party dependencies.

---

## 2. Architecture [MANDATORY]

### 2.1 Layer Model [NON-NEGOTIABLE]

    theme/
  features/
    <feature_name>/
      widgets/
      <feature_root>
domain/
  ...
data/
  ...
```

All modules MUST follow layering and dependency rules.

### 21.1 Modular Output Convention (Preferred) [MANDATORY]

For each technology, prefer an output-scoped, modular layout under `./outputs/<framework>/` to enforce isolation, artifact scoping, and extraction readiness:

``` shell
outputs/<framework>/
  pubspec/package manifest (or build config)
  lib/ or src/ (presentation + bootstrap for UI frameworks)
  packages/ (pure domain + data packages; no framework imports in domain/data)
  scripts/ (quality + automation for that platform only)
  .githooks/ (platform-scoped hooks overriding or complementing root hooks)
  .github/ (workflow files specific to platform if needed)
  test/ (integration + cross-package tests)
```

Rules:

- Domain & data packages MUST be framework-agnostic (no UI/context imports) [NON-NEGOTIABLE].
- Presentation/UI code MUST not import data implementations directly; use injected domain interfaces.
- Generated or tool-managed code MUST remain inside `outputs/<framework>/`.

---

## 26. Evolution [MANDATORY]

- Changes MUST be reviewed, versioned.

### 26.1 Governance & Versioning [MANDATORY]

- Amendment Procedure: Propose change via PR including diff + ADR rationale. Must be reviewed by 2 maintainers (or 1 maintainer + 1 platform lead) before merge.
- Version Policy (Semantic):
  - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible removal/redefinition of principles or compliance gates.
  - MINOR: Addition of new principles/sections or material expansion changing required behavior.
  - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
- Version Increment Flow: Determine bump type in PR description; reviewers MUST confirm classification.
- Review Cadence: Quarterly governance review (security, external standards, toolchain updates).
- Compliance Audits: Monthly automated report (lint, test coverage, dependency pinning, license scan). Exceptions require ADR with expiry date.
- Platform Extensions: Platform-specific constitutions MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT weaken global ones without an ADR.
- Deferred TODOs: MUST be resolved or re-validated at next quarterly review.
- Historical Archive: Previous versions retained in Git tags referencing constitution version (e.g., `constitution-v1.1.0`).

---

## 27. Branch Strategy (Flutter Flow) [MANDATORY]

- Linear history on main (no merge commits).
- Short-lived feature branches.
- Squash merges produce single commit.
- Semantic version tags (e.g., v1.4.2) on main.
- Hotfix from latest tag; squash back with patch bump.
- Only release/tag/emergency hotfix commits directly on main.
- CI enforces squash, rebase, successful pipeline before tag.
- Conventional commit messages after squash (feat:, fix:, perf:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:).
- Release commit aggregates changelog since previous tag.
- Branch naming:
  - feature/<ticket-id>-<short-description>
  - fix/<ticket-id>-<short-description>
  - hotfix/<ticket-id>-<short-description>
- Tags immutable (no retagging).
- Automated changelog from conventional commits.

---

## 28. External Standards & References [MANDATORY]

- Violations of SOLID or design pattern misuse MUST be flagged in code review and CI linting where possible.

---

## 30. Output Directory Convention [MANDATORY]

- All generated code, documentation, and artifacts MUST be placed under `./outputs/<framework>`.
- Each platform may maintain its own hooks/scripts inside `./outputs/<framework>/.githooks` and `./outputs/<framework>/scripts`.
- Root-level tooling MAY exist for shared tasks but MUST NOT duplicate platform-specific logic unnecessarily.
- CI and manual review MUST verify compliance (no stray source outside platform output except shared meta tooling).

---

## 31. Git Hooks & Local Quality Enforcement [MANDATORY]

- SpecKit MAY be configured to generate, validate, and install hooks across root and platform outputs as described.
- Hooks MAY be centralized at repo root (`.githooks/`) OR scoped per platform under `./outputs/<framework>/.githooks`.
- Required hook behaviors (irrespective of location):
  - `pre-commit`: formatting, static analysis (or subset), secret scan, license placeholder scan, English-only spec check, output directory enforcement, pinned version check.
  - `commit-msg`: Conventional Commits pattern: `^(feat|fix|perf|refactor|docs|test|chore|ci|build)(\(.+\))?: .+`.
  - `pre-push`: fast unit test subset + build (or dry-run) + coverage sanity.
- Average `pre-commit` runtime target: <5s (warn if exceeded, fail if >10s unless ADR exception).
- Platform-scoped hooks MUST set `core.hooksPath` to their directory via setup script inside `outputs/<framework>/scripts`.
- CI MUST verify hook integrity (optional hash) and that commits follow Conventional Commits.
- Exceptions MUST be recorded in ADR with justification and expiry.

### 31.1 English-only Spec Enforcement

- Same as previously defined; applies to all `specs/**/*.md` and `.specify/memory/**/*.md`.

### 31.2 Secret & Credential Scan (Placeholder)

- Required patterns enforced; platform scripts MAY extend scanning with technology-specific secrets.

### 31.3 Build Sanity

- Each platform hook MUST perform minimal build (Flutter debug build, Gradle assemble, Xcode build, etc.).
